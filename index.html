        <p>
        Maasai Mara, also known as Masai Mara, and locally simply as The Mara, is a large game reserve in Narok County, Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It is named in honor of the <em> <strong>Maasai people</strong></em> (the ancestral inhabitants of the area) and their description of the area when looked at from afar: "<strong>Mara</strong>" means "<strong>spotted</strong>" in the local Maasai language of Maa, due to the many trees which dot the landscape.</p>
